# ONLINE-GROCERY-STORE
An online platform for grocery needs

---
The “Online Grocery Store” software was completely developed. The project was able
to provide us with practical knowledge on making a website and designing the database
with the help of HTML, CSS, javascript, and PHP. The website was developed so as to
permit the purchasing of items for a Grocery Store.

Grocery stores are very much needed in our daily lives so having online grocery
shopping would benefit the business and the customer. The customer will be able to
purchase products from the comfort of their own home and pay for the items from
home. It benefits the shop owner as they can gain more customers who might want to
check products available or buy online.

The application was able to allow the users to view all the products and register on the
site. Those registered users can then proceed to payment after adding the products they
need into the cart. XAMPP server helped in the storage of users and products. The
administration had a secure page to add, modify or delete the products.
The project deals with all the important functionalities needed to provide a great
shopping experience. Therefore, we conclude that this project really helped in
deepening our knowledge and gaining more experience in the topic. Future
development that can be made to the proposed system is: hosting the platform on an
online server to make it accessible to others.
